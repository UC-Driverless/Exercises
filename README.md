# Exercises

Exercise 1:

- Create a ros2 workspace and place the exercise files in it.
- Determine how many topics are in the bag.
- Determine the Hz of the topic image.
- Determine the Hz of the topic system.
- Determine what does the topic system return .
- Create a node that publishes a message of type std_msgs float64 on topic /test (an example 0 or 1) every time the system node publishes a piece of data on the topic (you have to use the bag!).
    - 1 extra point if you do the node in cpp
- Create a GitHub account with an acceptable name (Ex. no LollinoProgrammino), create a repo and upload a .txt with the answers or the commands used to the first 5 requests.
- Download Foxglove, open the bag with foxglove, create a plot of the system and one with the image, take a screenshot and put it in the GitHub readme file.
- Send a msg with the link of the repo to Raffaele or Lorenzo.

Exercise 2:

Ohhhhh, there are a lot of bugs in this code, can you find and fix them?
Once you have fixed the codes and found out why the node crashes, send a message to Raffaele with the solution. 
You must use all the knowledge from exercise 1.
